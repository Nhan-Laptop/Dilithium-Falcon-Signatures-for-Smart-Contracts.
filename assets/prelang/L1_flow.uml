title Ethereum / L1 Transaction Flow Activity Diagram

|User / Wallet|
start
:Create Transaction (Recipient Address, Amount, Gas Fee);
:Sign Transaction with Private Key;

|Ethereum Network (Mempool)|
:Broadcast Signed Transaction to Network;
:Transaction enters the Mempool and waits for selection;
note right: Higher Gas fees increase priority

|Validator|
:Validator is selected to propose a new block;
:Selects a set of transactions from the Mempool;
:Executes transaction logic via the EVM (e.g., update balances, run smart contract);
:Bundles executed transactions into a new Block;
:Proposes the new Block to the rest of the network;
:Other validators attest to the Block's validity;

if (Block receives enough attestations?) then (yes)
    |Blockchain|
    :Add Block to the Chain;
    :Block achieves Finality, becoming immutable;
    :Update the global state (Account balances are now officially changed);
else (no)
    |Validator|
    :Block is Discarded;
    note left: Transactions are returned to the Mempool
endif

stop
